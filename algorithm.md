# Genetic Algorithm Overview

This document provides a brief overview of the steps involved in implementing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based on specified parameters.

## 1. Population Generation
- **Input Parameters**: `group_size` and `bit_size`.
- **Process**: Create an initial population of individuals (chromosomes). Each individual is represented as a binary string (or a list of bits) of length `bit_size`. The total number of individuals in the population is defined by `group_size`.

## 2. Finding Supremes
- **Input Parameter**: `superior_size`.
- **Process**: Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population using a fitness function. Select the top `superior_size` individuals based on their fitness scores. These individuals are referred to as "superior" or "elite" individuals.

## 3. Crossover of Superiors
- **Process**: Perform crossover (recombination) among the selected superior individuals. This involves exchanging segments of their binary strings to create new offspring. This step helps combine the best traits from the superior individuals.

## 4. Crossover and Selection of the Entire Population
- **Process**: After creating offspring from superiors, perform crossover across the entire population. This can involve randomly pairing individuals and exchanging segments to produce new offspring. Then, evaluate the fitness of all offspring and select the best individuals to form the next generation.

## 5. Mutation Application
- **Process**: Apply mutation to the new generation of individuals. This involves randomly flipping bits in the binary strings with a certain mutation probability. Mutation introduces diversity and helps prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima.

## Summary Flow
1. Generate an initial population using `group_size` and `bit_size`.
2. Evaluate fitness and identify the top `superior_size` individuals.
3. Crossover among the superior individuals to create offspring.
4. Perform crossover for the entire population and select the best individuals for the next generation.
5. Apply mutation to introduce diversity in the new generation.

This structured approach facilitates the implementation of a genetic algorithm, allowing for effective exploration and optimization of solutions.
