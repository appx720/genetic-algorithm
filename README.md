# Genetic Algorithm Implementation and Analysis

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) designed to solve optimization problems. The GA is enhanced with an analysis feature that evaluates various parameter combinations and saves the results in a JSON format for further inspection.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm**: Implements selection, crossover, and mutation operations to evolve a population of candidate solutions.
- **Parameter Analysis**: Automatically tests different combinations of parameters such as bit size, group size, superior size, and rotation count.
- **JSON Output**: Results of the analysis, including the ratio of '1' bits in the final population, are saved in a structured JSON file for easy access and review.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Any necessary libraries (if applicable) can be listed here.
